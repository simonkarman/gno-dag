# GNO Dag 2025
The GNO (Gender Neutrale Ouder) dag website for 2025.

## Getting Started
To get started with local development on GNO Dag 2025, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository.

2. Start the Krmx server:
    ```bash
    cd server/
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

3. Then, start the client (in another terminal window):
    ```bash
    cd client/
    npm install
    npm run dev
    ```

4. Now the server and client are running on your local machine. You can access the client at `http://localhost:3000` and the Krmx server at `http://localhost:8082`.

5. Both are set up with hot reloading, so you can make changes to the code and see them reflected in the browser immediately.
